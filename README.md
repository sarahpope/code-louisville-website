#Code Louisville 

## Installation
This is a wrapper to use Ghost as a npm module. By doing this, we keep the `/core` files untouched while versioning our `/content` directory.

To install, simply run:

#### Quickstart:

1. `npm install -g grunt-cli`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm install` to install ghost
1. Run `node index.js`

---

#### Contributing

1. `gem install bourbon neat bitters`
